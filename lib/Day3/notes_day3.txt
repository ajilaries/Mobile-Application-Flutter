What is a Widget? - Everything is a widget

Stateless Widget- Ui doesnt change after it is build  and which is used for static content

example use cases: text, icon, static ui screens
it has only 
build() is called only when the widget is first rendered

Struture

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget{
    const MyWidget({super.key});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context){
        return Text("Hello");
    }
}
use cases which is used for creating static ui like logo, icons, labels and static profile info and appbar title


Statefull Widgets
a widget that can change its ui dynamically during runtime
used when data changes

Internal Working 
Stateful widget is actually TWO CLASSES
1, Widget class-Immutatble(ui configuration)
    
    class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget

2, State class -Mutable (data+logic)

    class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget>


Lifecycle Flow
1.createState()
    Flutter creates the state object
2.initState()
    called once and which is used for API calls, controllers and inital values
3.build()
    creates ui and which is called first time after setState()
4.setState()
    This is the trigger it tells flutter: data has changed rebuild the ui 
     
    flutter then calls build() again.
5.dispose() 
    called when widget is removed
    used for closing controllers, stopping animations and clearing memory


Struture

class Counter extends StatefulWidget{
    const Counter({super.key});

    @override
    State<Counter> createState()=>_CounterState();

}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter>{
    int count=0;

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context){
        return Column(
            children:[
                Text("$count),
                ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed:(){
                        setState((){
                            count++;
                        });
                    },
                    child: Text("increment"),
                )
            ],
        );
    }
}


Mutable means can be changed after it is created
Immutatble mean cannot be changed after it is created
